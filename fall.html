        <p>
            Fall is an idyllic time to take a romantic getaway at
            the Couples Resort and visit Algonquin Park, Muskoka.
            Summer has given way to brisk, invigorating autumn air.
            Fall days remain long, making it comfortable to stay outside
            for long periods and to enjoy perfect walking and hiking
            conditions on an endless system of trails.
            Nothing says Fall more than fall colors in Algonquin Park,
            which is known to have some of the most brilliant changes of
            season throughout Ontario. Considered a Signature Canadian
            Experience bringing visitors from around the world, who are
            attracted by the outstanding fall colour viewing opportunities,
            but there are many other things to see and do.
        </p>
        <img src="images/mob-lake.jpg" alt="fall activities 1" />
        <p>
            Wherever you plan to roam this fall, make it
            especially romantic by taking advantage of
            one of our fall packages designed for couples in love.
            The fall colors alone make a trip to Algonquin-Muskoka worthwhile,
            especially if you catch the spectacular colors of the sugar and red
            maples from the 20th of September to mid-October. Then, the
            yellow aspens, golden tamaracks, and red oaks reach their peak
            shortly after, creating another vivid display before giving way to a more subdued November.
            Live Algonquin Park webcam
            Mid-September to mid-October is the prime time to view the flaming
            red maple, deep yellow poplar, and white-barked birch tree leaves.
            These colors become the backdrop for touring artisan studios, enjoying
            fall photography workshops, and hunting for great antiques.
            Clothing rentals 
            We have outdoor clothing to keep you warm and dry, including 100%
            windproof and waterproof pants and jackets with polar fleece interiors,
            we recommend that you bring good hiking shoes.

        <p>
            During late fall, you have a great chance of spotting a large bull
            moose, now with full-grown, polished antlers ready for the
            rutting (mating) seasonâ€”remember to give them plenty of space.
            Fall evenings are also ideal for wolf howling; you might even try it yourself.

          Rugged surroundings can compel you to mount up on your own trail horse
          and go on a guided trail ride. For those with an appetite for the
          outback, grab your old jeans and head off into the wilderness. There
          is nothing quite like exploring the Algonquin wilderness on horseback

          <br />
          <br />An important form of transportation for the Algonquin natives
          has always been the use of canoes on the beautiful lakes and rivers.
          Canoes and kayaks permit you to travel deep into Algonquin Park on our
          Galeairy Lake still as pristine as ever.
